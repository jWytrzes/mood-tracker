# Mood Tracker

App: [https://moodtracker-24d44.web.app/](https://moodtracker-24d44.web.app/)

It is a simple web application that allows the user to keep track of their daily moods. Every day user can select how do they feel and type a note. Then they can easily check choosen mood and journal note on the calendar. There is also a chart showing the percentage of each mood across the dataset.

This is just a training app (at least for now) so on the calednar page there is an option to generate random data for the last year in order to present how the application looks when it's filled with information.

The application was built using React and Firebase.
